getdata-007_course_project
==========================

This course project for the Coursera getdata-007 course. It consists of 3 files:

- run_Analysis.R (the script),
- CodeBook.md,
- README.md.

Use:

- Download run_Analysis.R into your working directory
- From R, type "source("run_Analysis.R")".

IMPORTANT: The script requires data files to run correctly. You must download the "UCI HAR Dataset.zip" and extract its content in your working directory, keeping the folder structure.

After running the script, you'll find the 2 tidy data sets (tidy1 and tidy2) in your R console and the content of tidy2 will be written in "output.txt" in your working directory.
